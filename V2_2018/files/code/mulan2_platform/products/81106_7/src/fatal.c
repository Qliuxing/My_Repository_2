/*
 *  NOTES:
 *      1.  All functions in this module should be defined with __MLX_TEXT__
 *          attribute. Thus they will be linked in first half of the Flash.
 *
 *      2.  This module should NOT use _initialized_ global and static variables!
 *          Such variables are linked into .data or .dp.data sections and their
 *          initialization lists are stored at load address (LMA) in the Flash.
 *          Since there is no control on the position of the load address, the
 *          linker might link it to second half of the Flash and thus
 *          initialization values will be overwritten by the loader during
 *          programming of the a new application. As a result, variables in .data
 *          sections will not be correctly initialized.
 *          Use uninitialized variables instead (will be linked to .bss section).
